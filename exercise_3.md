Exercise 3 - Using GitHub
-------------------------
1. Create a remote repository for your ic1-ex2 project.
  * Open GitHub in your browser (https://github.com/)and sign in
  * Click on + and select New Repository
    * Name the repository ic1-ex2and provide a description. You may make the
      repository public and you do not need to create a README.md file because
      there is already a readme file in your local project
2. Click on the green Clone or Download button and copy the URL link to the clipboard. You will need it later
3. Add a remote bookmark to the repository.
  * git add remote URL-for-the-project
4. Push your local repository to GitHub.
  * gitpush â€“u origin master
5. Make changes to the repository on GitHub
  * Edit readme.mdin some way on GitHub and commit the changes
  * Add a new file on GitHub that answers the following question:
  * Do you like the Star Wars universe or the Star Trek universe more? Explain why.
  * Commit the new file to GitHub
6. Fetch the changes from GitHub to your local repository
  * git fetch
7. Use git log, git status, git diff, etc. to see the effect of the Fetch. Take notes you will need them for the next exercise
